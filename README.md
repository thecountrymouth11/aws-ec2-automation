# EC2 Deployment Automation

## What This Does
1. `deploy.sh` - My first script that:
   - Logs into an EC2 server
   - Runs system updates
   - Checks the server is working

2. `deploy_ec2.sh` - My improved script that:
   - Creates NEW EC2 servers automatically
   - Sets up SSH access
   - Shows how to connect to the new server
   - Gives the command to delete the server when done
